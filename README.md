# 👋 Hi, I'm Santosh Rajkumar  

🎓 **Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering**  
**The Ohio State University · SOAR Lab (Systems Optimization, Autonomy & Robotics)**  

🔧 I build **real-time control algorithms** that bridge nonlinear dynamics, convex optimization, and learning — focusing on **Koopman-based Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for autonomous systems.
